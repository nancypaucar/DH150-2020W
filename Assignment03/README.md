Describe your project design challenge + target user (step1+2)
Describe your research methods and plan (step3)

Step01: Specify the main design challenge 
What is the main activity your project would support the users?
My project will help users find a church that connects with their religious beliefs and makes them feel like they have a safe, welcoming, and social family in a relitous setting.  
What is the basic need involved for that activity? (reference)
The basic need involved for this activity is social belonging. A lack of belonging can affect the individual's ability to form and maintain emotionally significant relationships in general.
What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
People usually hang out with close friends or family to satisfy their needs.
What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
This technology will help improve the limitations of having difficulty finding and searching for a long time for a community of people who share similar beleifs. 

Step02: Target users 
What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
I sought users who are representative of the target market for my application. In particular, I sought out people who were religious and were familiar with church settings and activities. They were at one point members of a different church.
Where would the users do that activity?
The users would do the activity in their homes of the users, often at their desks. 
What would the users do to complete that activity? 
To complete the activity, the users would use the Internet to find a church near their home location or they would go to church locations in person to find out in person if they like the church environment. 

Step03: Pick an observation method (or a combination of methods) 
Interview with direct / Passive / Participatory observation* (recommended)
Or something you learned on your own (refer the field guideline by IDEO)

Write a short paragraph reflecting on your experience of planning and conducting an interview. 
Short reflection on what you learned and what you will do differently in the future.

## Reflection
For my interview I prepared a script that would allow me to conduct an interview that flowed and led me to gain an understanding of the users. During the interview, I asked the interviewee a few questions related to and later asked him to perform a general task of what he usually does when he is looking for religious information. After the interview, I learned that a regular church member finds that having a more modern and updated church website looks more appealing and
