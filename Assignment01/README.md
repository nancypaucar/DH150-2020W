# Christian Church UX Redesign

## DH150 Assignment01: Heuristic Evaluation by Nancy Paucar

### Motivation + Description of the community
I wanted to redesign this website because I frequently visit this church when I go back home since I am Christian.  I feel that improvements made to the site will help new community members looking for a new church understand the church's focused values and culture. I feel that this website design is oudated and needs a more modern development. This is a Christian community who seeks to bring others to Christ and share teachings from the Bible. They do missionary work and raise funds to support other missionaries as well.

## Information about the Website for the first heuristic evaluation

###### Brief evaluation of the website:
Based on initial impression of the website, I feel that it needs to limit the amount of text it contains. It feels cluttered and is exhausting to read through. The antiquated aesthetics and organization of the site also do not make me think that this is a very bright and friendly community. There's also many problems with media content on their site. I am having trouble understanding the church's main focuses and goals.

### 1: Visibility of system status
###### Examples: 

Pros: No real issues with visibility of system status. My network and battery status in the church website mostly come from my computer operating system.

### 2: Match between system and the real world 
###### Examples:

Cons: 

Youtube icon is small and unrecognizable, Word of the day page does not reflect that page or content is being updated daily as the name suggests, Share Faith website icon at the bottom of each site page is unrecognizable or commonly associated with the average person;

Severity rating (3)

### 3: User control and freedom
###### Examples:

Cons: Some pictures dont provide the user flexibility of escaping like a little x in the corner or canceling button

![cancelbutton](https://i.postimg.cc/qBxHScK8/Screen-Shot-2020-02-18-at-12-27-46-AM.png)

This is what appears on the screen after I click a picture. 

Severity rating (1)

### 4: Consistency and standards
###### Examples:

Cons: Different font heights and text colors create a lack of clear headlines and clickable text, No text or documentation on Devotional page,

There are two main tab bars. There is one at the top and bottom of every page in the site which is confusing for the user since the bottom bar has additional unknown use icons and the bottom main tab mar doesnt have drop down options like the top main tab bar, 


Severity rating (2)

###### Examples:

Pros: Required fields message on contact form

Cons: No constraints on word count on contact form,

### 6: Recognition rather than recall
###### Examples:
