#### Summary: Accessibility Audit

The purpose of my Accessibility Audit was to determine if there were any problems with my prototype color contrast scheme and to see if there was any other problems with accessibility in my prototype. I used Chrome developer tool and audit functions to run the audit. The audit said my prototype passed the accessibility test in background and foreground color contrast ratio. I learned that accessibility audits can help you determine if certain interactive components or color choices on prototypes limit users from navigating through website with ease.
