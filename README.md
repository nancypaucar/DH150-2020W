# CCWO Church Website Redesign
## DH150 UX Design, Nancy Paucar

## About the Project

This project involves redesigning the mobile app user experience design for the Community Chapel World Outreach church website. I wanted to redesign this website because my family and I frequently visit this church when I go back home. I want to create a redesign that has many interactive components and an appealing aesthetic design that will allow users to understand the community and values of the church easily and quickly while using the site. 

## Design statement: 
What is the issue and Why do you think it is important to resolve that issue by your project? 

I wanted to redesign this website because I feel that improvements made to the site will help new community members looking for a new church understand the church's focused values and culture. I feel that this website design is oudated and needs a more modern development. The website feels cluttered and is exhausting to read through because of the large amount of text and lack of interactive elements. The antiquated aesthetics and organization of the site also do not make me think that this is a very bright and friendly community. There was also many problems with accessing the media content on their site easily. I also had trouble understanding the church's main values and community.


## Competitor analysis [assignment01 & 02]:
Summary and link to the heuristics and usability testing of the *existing* product(s) - or the *original* website you evaluated

For the Heuristics Evaluation, I wanted analyze CCWO's church website's usability in order to suggest an improved user experience design. I found a few problems every one of the 10 heuristics except visibility of system status. It had severe problems with usability such as: Match between system and the real world, consistency and standards, and aesthetic and minimalist design. This was mostly due to the fact that the website's icons were small and unrecognizable, the site had different font heights and text colors creating a lack of clear headlines and clickable text, the website color background was too dark making it difficult to see fonts well an, too much text content made website look cluttered, and the map on the contacts page was very small to see and hard to identify streets. These problems made the website content exhausting to read through. The antiquated aesthetics and organization of the site also did not make me think that the church was a bright and friendly community. It also made it hard to access the media content on their site. 

For Gloria's restauratnt website, I wanted analyze a restaurant's website's usability in order to suggest an improved user experience design. There was some problems with Aesthetic and minimalist design, consistency and standards and match between system and the real world.

The purpose of the Usability Testing was to learn about how easy it is for a user to learn and use the Community Chapel World Outreach website. I wanted to test the usability features of the website by letting the user navigate through the media content of the site. I want to see how they respond and proceed to use the site with the missing videos. I also want to test the aesthetic and minimalistic design aspects of the website by testing if they can find information about church activities with the cluttered and unorganized look of the site. Additionally, I want to check if the person can find information about events that are currently taking place in the real world with the tools and documentation presented on the site. 
In the pilot test, I learned that the UT process can get out of hand without clear instructions given to participating users. Many times the user got distracted or forgot the questions he was trying to answer because he got lost in looking at the website's features. I want to improve my UT in the future by making clearer questions and also providing a more private room for the participant to do UT without any distractions.

## User research [contextual inquiry, assignment04]:

### Summary and link to your assignment folder

The purpose of the user research was to try to understand what Christian people commonly look up on the Internet in relation to church environments. For my user research, I interviewed a member of the Christian community since they would know how to use a church website best. I prepared a script that allowed me to conduct an interview which led me to gain an understanding of the Christian population website needs. During the interview, I asked the interviewee a few questions related to how he conducts religous research and later asked him to perform a general task of what he usually does when he is looking for religious information. I observed their comments and user journey and audio recorded our conversation. After the interview, I learned that a regular member commonly looks for social events on a church website. I also learned that having Google's integration into the website makes it a lot easier for users to save religious related searches, find directions to certain church events, and find the church website in general. I also learned that images and videos give a better summary about a church's environment than long pages of text. In my UT, some of my questions were a little too broad which might have confused the reader on how to answer. I thought my interview went smoothly for the most part since my participant was very knowledgable about religious settings. I also thought that I did a good job of finding ways to have the participant expand his answers to get more information out of their user experience.

## UX storytelling [persona+scenario, assignment05]
### Summary and link to your assignment folder

To develop my ux storytelling, I developed 3 personas for which my prototype church website would support. My personas were called Kate Glass, Cindy May, and Tim Burton. With these personas, I added their demographic, personality traits, skills, and motivations and needs related to the work and goals related to my design problem. I created a persona called Cindy May who is very organized and is a planner. She just moved into the city and was interested in visiting the CCWO church. I also created a persona called Kate Glass who is a social media influencer and is very technologically advanced. She was interested in looking for media content on the CCWO church site to find out more about the church before visiting. I also created a persona called Tim Burton who is very outgoing and social. He was interested in meeting new people and getting more involved in church events.  I incorporated into my personas key characteristics that I thought might determine how similar users would respond to the features I provided in my final prototype. Based on these personas, I created at least three tasks that demonstrated the envisioned functionality that I considered adding for my final design solutions.  I also created journey maps for each scenario to track the user’s emotion and actions in a user timeline.

## Wireframe and graphic design element variation [assignment06 + part of 08]

### Low-fidelity prototype (wireflow, assignment06)

#### Summary and link to the sketches (may contains the multiple versions and evaluation history)

After creating personas, doing user research, I created wireframes that fulfilled some of their needs on a church website. To address Cindy May's needs, I decided to create a "Get Directions" button feature on the church mobile app that linked the "I'm New" page to the Google Maps site. This would allow people who want to know how to get to CCWO church get directions faster and easier. For Kate Glass, I added a category button features on the "Media" page to organize the media content into distinct categories: gallery and sermon audio. Anyone looking for media content could look through the gallery and audio pages to get a better visualization of the church environment. For Tim Burton, I added clickable buttons labeled by the days of the week to the "Events" page. This would allow the user to find events organized by the days of the week. I tested the wireflow of my prototype with a user participant to gather feedback on my system’s user interactions. In the process of preparing the low fidelity prototype, I learned that required a lot of thinking about different user journeys from beginning to end. There were many problems with my wireframes that I had to revise multiple times until the user could reach their desired activity goal on the church website.

### High-fidelity prototype (functional/interactive prototype, assignment08)

#### Summary statement and link to or an embedded prototype

[Link to Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/spqvQ7lEEgfrBgWIhpYTB4/Revised-DH150-CCWO-Website-Prototype?node-id=40%3A2&scaling=scale-down.md)

The purpose of this high-fidelity prototype was to vizualize information and interactive components in an iPhone 8 mobile screen size. I learned how to evaluate alternative ways to design a component of a mobile app system. The purpose was also to validify the interaction flow that I previously created in a my wireframe and made sure it did not have any dead ends. In the process to make a high-fidelity prototype, I learned how to use Figma, choose a color scheme, digitize my wireframes, and apply those wireframes with graphic design principles and make it support interactive components. One of the tasks the prototype demonstrated was letting users get directions to the CCWO church faster and easier. I created a "Get Directions" button feature on the church mobile app that linked the "I'm New" page to the Google Maps site. Another task that the prototype demonstrated was letting users find media content on the website easily to get a better idea of the church environment. I added large buttons on the "Media" page to organize the media content into distinct categories: gallery and sermon audio. The third task that the prototype demonstrated was letting users find events to participate in easily and quickly. I added clickable buttons labeled by the days of the week to the "Events" page. This allowed users to find events organized by the days of the week. Like the wireframes, I had multiple revisions to my final prototype to make sure that the user could reach their desired activity goal on the church website quickly and easily.

## Conclusion: what you learned throughout the process

Through the whole process, I was suprised by how much research and preparation UX designing requires  before you even start making a prototype for a website or mobile application. I learned how to find  I never had done usability testing in past so this class taught me how to ask the right questions and how to create a safe setting for users to participate in. I learned how to use Figma to design my prototype.
