# Church Website Redesign
## DH150 UX Design, Nancy Paucar

## About the Project
What is the project about? The motivation of the project and possible contribution.

This project involves the mobile app user experience design for the ocmmunity with the similar aesthetical taste. 
## Design statement: 
What is the issue and Why do you think it is important to resolve that issue by your project? 

## Competitor analysis [assignment01 & 02]:
Summary and link to the heuristics and usability testing of the *existing* product(s) - or the *original* website you evaluated

For the Heuristics Evaluation, I wanted analyze CCWO's church website's usability in order to suggest an improved user experience design. I found a few problems every one of the 10 heuristics except visibility of system status. It had severe problems with usability such as: Match between system and the real world, Consistency and standards, and Aesthetic and minimalist design. This was mostly due to the fact that the website's icons were small and unrecognizable, the site had different font heights and text colors creating a lack of clear headlines and clickable text, the website color background was too dark making it difficult to see fonts well an, too much text content made website look cluttered, and the map on the contacts page was very small to see and hard to identify streets. These problems made the website content exhausting to read through. The antiquated aesthetics and organization of the site also did not make me think that the church was a bright and friendly community. It also made it hard to access the media content on their site. 

For Gloria's restauratnt website, I wanted analyze a restaurant's website's usability in order to suggest an improved user experience design. There was some problems with Aesthetic and minimalist design, consistency and standards and match between system and the real world.

The purpose of the Usability Testing was to learn about how easy it is for a user to learn and use the Community Chapel World Outreach website. I wanted to test the usability features of the website by letting the user navigate through the media content of the site. I want to see how they respond and proceed to use the site with the missing videos. I also want to test the aesthetic and minimalistic design aspects of the website by testing if they can find information about church activities with the cluttered and unorganized look of the site. Additionally, I want to check if the person can find information about events that are currently taking place in the real world with the tools and documentation presented on the site. 
In the pilot test, I learned that the UT process can get out of hand without clear instructions given to participating users. Many times the user got distracted or forgot the questions he was trying to answer because he got lost in looking at the website's features. I want to improve my UT in the future by making clearer questions and also providing a more private room for the participant to do UT without any distractions.

## User research [contextual inquiry, assignment04]:
Summary and link to your assignment folder

For my project design challenge, I will try to understand what Christian people commonly look up on the Internet in relation to church environments. The project design activity will involve having a participant research religious information they will typically do on a weekly basis. I am keeping the activity very broad since there is only a limited amount of sites where church members commonly look up religious information for churches. The basic need involved for this activity is users wanting to find information to feel a social belonging in church settings. To satisfy this need, people traditionally contact a church member directly or use the Internet to find the religious information they are looking for. Digital technology will help improve the limitations of having difficulty finding and searching for a community of people who share similar beleifs. I sought out users who are representative of the target market for my application. In particular, I sought out people who were Christian and were familiar with church settings, culture and activities. The user would usually perform the activity I asked them to do in their home, often at their desks. To complete the activity, the user needs to use the Internet or they need to go to a church location in person. For this activity, I will be doing a direct interview with a religious participant as my research method. I will ask them to search up certain information on the Internet and observe their comments and user journey. I will be audio recording our conversation, which will be guided by a preprepared script. With the information I recieve from this activity, I will be able to design a website application that helps users fill the need of social belonging with a specific church and also let new members understand a church's core values and culture.

### Low-fidelity prototype (wireflow, assignment06)
Summary and link to the sketches (may contains the multiple versions and evaluation history)

In my user research, I learned that when looking a a church website, most church members often look for the time and place of events at a church. I also learned that people looking for a new church like to look for media content to visualize the church community before visiting. New people also look at a church website to get directions for how to get to the church. People also feel a website looks more professional when it is less cluttered and has easy to use buttons. I created a persona called Cindy May who is very organized and is a planner. She just moved into the city and was interested in visiting the CCWO church. I also created a persona called Kate Glass who is a social media influencer and is very technologically advanced. She was interested in looking for media content on the CCWO church site to find out more about the church before visiting. I also created a persona called Tim Burton who is very outgoing and social. He was interested in meeting new people and getting more involved in church events. For Cindy May, I decided to create a "Get Directions" button feature on the church mobile app that linked the "I'm New" page to the Google Maps site. This would allow people who want to know how to get to CCWO church get directions faster and easier. For Kate Glass, I added a category button features on the "Media" page to organize the media content into distinct categories: gallery and sermon audio. Anyone looking for media content could look through the gallery and audio pages to get a better visualization of the church environment. For Tim Burton, I added clickable buttons labeled by the days of the week to the "Events" page. This would allow the user to find events organized by the days of the week. The purpose of this low fidelity prototyping is to begin working through how exactly the user will interact with the mobile application I am designing. The purpose is also to gather feedback on my systemâ€™s user interactions by creating a paper prototype and testing it with another person.

### High-fidelity prototype (functional/interactive prototype, assignment08)
Summary statement and link to or an embedded prototype

[Link to Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/spqvQ7lEEgfrBgWIhpYTB4/Revised-DH150-CCWO-Website-Prototype?node-id=40%3A2&scaling=scale-down.md)

This project involves redesigning a church website from my hometown. The purpose of this high-fidelity prototype is to vizualize information and interactive components in an iPhone 8 mobile screen size. I will learn how to evaluate alternative ways to design a component of a system. The purpose is also to validify the interaction flow that I previously created in a my wireframe and make sure it does not have any dead ends. In the process to make a high-fidelity prototype, I will need to learn how to use Figma, digitize my wireframes, and apply those wireframes with graphic design principles and make it support interactive components, text readability, easy to understand information layout and finally choose a color scheme. One of the tasks the prototype demonstrates is letting users get directions to the CCWO church faster and easier. I decided to create a "Get Directions" button feature on the church mobile app that linked the "I'm New" page to the Google Maps site. Another task that this prototype demonstrates is letting users find media content on the website easily to get a better idea of the church environment. I added large buttons on the "Media" page to organize the media content into distinct categories: gallery and sermon audio. The third task that this prototype demonstrates is letting users find events to participate in easily and quickly. I added clickable buttons labeled by the days of the week to the "Events" page. This would allow the user to find events organized by the days of the week.
