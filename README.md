## DH150 Assignment01: Heuristic Evaluation by Nancy Paucar
I wanted to redesign this website because I frequently visit this church when I go back home since I am Christian.  I feel that improvements made to the site will help new community members looking for a new church understand the church's focused values and culture. I feel that this website design is oudated and needs a more modern development. This is a Christian community who seeks to bring others to Christ and share teachings from the Bible. They do missionary work and raise funds tosupport other missionaries as well.
