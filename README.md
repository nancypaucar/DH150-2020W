# CCWO Church Website Redesign

## DH150 UX Design, Nancy Paucar

## About the Project

This project involves redesigning the mobile app user experience for the Community Chapel World Outreach church website. I wanted to redesign this website because my family and I frequently visit this church when I go back home. My goal was to create a website redesign that had many interactive components and appealing aesthetics that would allow users to understand the community and values of the church easily and quickly while using the site. 

## Design statement 

For new community members looking for a new church, it is very difficult to understand a church's values and culture. Before visiting a church, users will often search multiple times and click countless resources on a church website before gaining sufficient knowledge as to whether they want to plan a trip to a church. If they do not find what they are looking for on a church website, they will look at other church websites, starting the research cycle all over again. The antiquated aesthetics, lack of organization and unnecessary information from the CCWO website can deter users from connecting with the church in person. Solving this issue in finding information easily on a church website will help new church goers build relationships with people in nearby churches and give them the opportunity to reconnect with their religious backgrounds. 

## Competitor analysis: Heuristic Evaluation

I wanted analyze the CCWO church website's usability in order to suggest an improved user experience design. For the heuristics evaluation, I went through the current CCWO website and looked for problems with usability based on Nielson’s 10 heuristics. I wanted analyze the church website's usability in order to suggest an improved user experience design. I found a few problems with every one of the 10 heuristics except visibility of system status. It had severe usability problems with match between system and the real world, consistency and standards, and aesthetic and minimalist design. 

For Gloria's restauratnt website, I wanted analyze the restaurant website's usability in order to suggest an improved user experience design. There was some problems with aesthetic and minimalist design, consistency and standards and match between system and the real world.

## Competitor analysis: Usability Testing

The purpose of the usability testing was to learn about how easy it was for users to use the Community Chapel World Outreach website. I recorded participating users navigating through and noted their feedback on what issues they had with the site. I learned that they had trouble accessing the media content of the site because of unexplained missing videos. I tested if the users could find information about church activities with the cluttered and unorganized look of the site. Additionally, I checked if the user could find information about events that were currently taking place with the tools and documentation presented on the site. I learned that the UT process can get out of hand without clear instructions given to participating users. I want to improve my UT in the future by making clearer questions and also providing a more private room for the participant to do UT without any distractions.

## User research [contextual inquiry]:

The purpose of the this contextual inquiry was to try to understand what Christian people commonly look up on the Internet in relation to church environments. For my user research, I prepared a script that allowed me to conduct an interview and gain an understanding of the Christian population needs. During the interview, I asked the interviewee a few questions related to how he conducts religous research and later asked him to perform a general task of what he usually does when he is looking for religious information. I observed their comments and user journey and audio recorded our conversation. After the interview, I learned that a regular member commonly looks for social events on a church website. I also learned that having Google's integration into the website makes it a lot easier for users to find directions to certain church events. I also learned that images and videos give a better visual about a church's environment than long pages of text. I thought my interview went smoothly for the most part since I did a good job of finding ways to have the participant expand his answers to get more information out of their user experience.

## UX storytelling [persona+scenario]

The purpose of creating personas and scenarios was to debelop my UX storytelling. I created 3 personas for which my church website prototype would support. My personas were called Kate Glass, Cindy May, and Tim Burton. With these personas, I added their demographic information, personality traits, skills, , empathy map, motivations and needs related to my design problem. Cindy May was very organized and a planner. She just moved into the city and was interested in visiting the CCWO church. I also created a persona called Kate Glass who was a social media influencer and was very technologically advanced. She was interested in looking for media content on the CCWO church site to find out more about the church community before visiting. I also created a persona called Tim Burton who was very outgoing and social. He was interested in meeting new people and getting more involved in church events. Based on these personas, I created three scenarios/tasks that demonstrated the envisioned functionality that I considered adding for my final design solutions. I also created journey maps for each scenario to track each persona’s emotion and actions in their user timeline.

## Wireframe and graphic design element variation 

### Low-fidelity prototype (wireflow and testing)

#### Summary and link to the sketches (may contains the multiple versions and evaluation history)

After creating personas and doing user research, I created wireframes that fulfilled some of the church community's user needs on a church website. To address Cindy May's needs, I added features that would allow users, who want to know how to get to CCWO church, get directions faster and easier. For Kate Glass, I added interactive elements that would allow users to find media content of the church environment in a more oranized fashion. For Tim Burton, I added features that would allow users to find events organized by the days of the week. I tested the wireflow of my prototype with a user participant to gather feedback on my system’s user interactions. In the process of preparing the low fidelity prototype, I learned that wireframing required deep thinking about different user journeys from beginning to end. I had to revise my wireflows multiple times until the user could reach their desired activity goal on the church website. The wireflows document how the user would navigate through these screens.

### High-fidelity prototype (functional/interactive prototype)

The purpose of this high-fidelity prototype was to vizualize information and interactive components in an iPhone 8 mobile screen size. The purpose was also to validify the interaction flow that I previously created in a my wireframe and make sure it did not have any dead ends. In the process to make a high-fidelity prototype, I learned how to use Figma, choose a color scheme, digitize my wireframes, apply those wireframes with graphic design principles and make it support interactive components. One of the tasks the prototype demonstrated was letting users get directions to the CCWO church faster and easier. Another task that the prototype demonstrated was letting users find media content on the website easily to get a better idea of the church environment. The third task that the prototype demonstrated was letting users find events to participate in easily and quickly. Like the wireframes, I had multiple revisions to my final prototype to make sure that the user could reach their desired activity goal on the church website with no dead ends.

## Pitch video 

  
## Conclusion: what you learned throughout the process

Through the whole process, I learned that understanding user needs is more important than creating many prototype designs. Without proper user research and usability testing preparation, it becomes difficult to create apps that are useful for the general public. I realized that even though understanding user needs took a long time, it helped me develop an app that was simple, comprehensible and strategic. The design software programs that I used in the class only served to visualize every component in my user research together in the end. In the future, I want to know how to ask better questions for usability testing that will allow participating users to expand their answers on the problems within a website. I also want to learn how to use shortcuts for Figma to design my prototype at a quicker pace.
