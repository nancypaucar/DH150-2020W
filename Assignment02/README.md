# DH150 Assignment02 Usability Testing

### Introduction
The purpose of this UT is to learn about how easy it is for a user to learn and use the Community Chapel World Outreach website. In my heuristic evaluation, I learned that the website had the most issues with three aspects of UX design: recognition rather than recall, aesthetic and minimalistic design, and match between the system and the real world. I want to test the recognition rather than recall features of the website by letting the user navigate through the media content of the site. I want to see how they respond and proceed to use the site with the lack of recognition error messages from missing videos. I also want to test the aesthetic and minimalistic design aspects of the website by testing if they can find information about child church activities with the cluttered and unorganized look of the site. Additionally, I want to check the match between the system and the real world aspects of the site by testing if the person can find information about events that are currently taking place in the real world with the tools and documentation presented on the site.

### Summary
In the pilot test, I learned that the UT process can get out of hand without clear instructions given to participating users. Many times the user got distracted or forgot the questions he was trying to answer because he got lost in looking at the website's features. The UT testing went well because my UT participant spoke about everything that he was encountering on the website. The recording site, Active Presenter, also provided clear audio and visual of the whole UT process. The UT testing went wrong when I misread a few of the questions which confused the user on what they were asking. I felt that sometimes the user went all over the website to find the answers to the questions which took additional time and made the user feel exhausted. My grandma also came in the room during the UT testing which distracted the participant and moderator. I want to improve my UT in the future by making clearer questions and also providing a more private room for the participant to do UT without any distractions.
