# DH150 Assignment02 Usability Testing
One paragraph explaining the purpose of UT, how & what you want to test especially based on the findings of heuristic evaluation. 
The purpose of this UT is to learn about how easy it is for a user to learn and use the Community Chapel World Outreach website. I want to test the Recognition rather than recall features of the website by letting the users navigate through the media content of the site. I want to see how they respond and how they proceed to use the site with the lack of recognition error messages from missing videos. I also want to test the aesthetic organizational design of the website by identifying if it is easy for users to find basic information about how to get kids to participate in church activities/groups/classes.
