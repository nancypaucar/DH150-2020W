# DH150 Assignment02 Usability Testing

One paragraph explaining the purpose of UT, how & what you want to test especially based on the findings of heuristic evaluation. 

The purpose of this UT is to learn about how easy it is for a user to learn and use the Community Chapel World Outreach website. I want to test the Recognition Rather than Recall features of the website by letting the users navigate through the media content of the site. I want to see how they respond and how they proceed to use the site with the lack of recognition error messages from missing videos. I also want to test the Aesthetic and Minimalistic Design features of the website by testing if it is easy for users to find basic information about how to get kids to participate in church activities/groups/classes. I also want to test the Match Between the System and the Real World features of the site by testing if the person can find information about events that are currently taking place in the real world with the tools and documentation presented on the site.
