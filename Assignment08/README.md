## Summary
+1: Brief summary of the project, the process and the purpose of this high-fidelity prototype; the tasks the prototype demonstrates.

This project involves redesigning a church website from my hometown. The purpose of this high-fidelity prototype is to vizualize  information and interactive components in an iphone 8 mobile screen size. I will learn how to evaluate alternative ways to design a component of a system. The purpose is also to validify the interaction flow that I previously anticipated will branch out and not have dead ends. In the process to make a high-fidelity prototype, I will need to learn how to use Figma, digitize your wireframes, and apply those wireframes with graphic design principles and make it support interactive components, text legibility/readability, easy to understand information layout and finally choose a color scheme. One of the tasks the prototype demonstrates is letting users get  directions to the CCWO church faster and easier. I decided to create a "Get Directions" button feature on the church mobile app that linked the "I'm New" page to the Google Maps site. 
Another task that this prototype demonstrates is letting users find media content on the website easily to get a better idea of the church environment. I added a category button features on the "Media" page to organize the media content into distinct categories: gallery and sermon audio. 
The third task that this prototype demonstrates is letting users find events to participate in easily and quickly. I added clickable buttons labeled by the days of the week to the "Events" page. This would allow the user to find events organized by the days of the week. 

## Decisions for the Graphical Interface Design

+1: Thoughtful description about how you made the decisions for the graphical interface design (ex. Color scheme).

I added input controls like buttons and dropdown lists to take the user to new pages on the site easily. I added a search bar. I added navigational components like hyperlinks to take the user to new pages on the site and get more information about a certain topic. I used hyper links on words like "Learn more" and "View full screen". I added informational components like icons of social media sites so the user could easily identify familiar sites that they have been on before. 
I chose the color scheme by looking up church colors in Adobe Color Website. I check the accesibility color contrast with the website and noticed that
