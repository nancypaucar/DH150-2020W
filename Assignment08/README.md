# DH150 Assignment08 by Nancy Paucar: High Fidelity Prototype

## Summary

This project involves redesigning a church website from my hometown. The purpose of this high-fidelity prototype is to vizualize  information and interactive components in an iPhone 8 mobile screen size. I will learn how to evaluate alternative ways to design a component of a system. The purpose is also to validify the interaction flow that I previously created in a my wireframe and make sure it does not have any dead ends. In the process to make a high-fidelity prototype, I will need to learn how to use Figma, digitize my wireframes, and apply those wireframes with graphic design principles and make it support interactive components, text readability, easy to understand information layout and finally choose a color scheme. One of the tasks the prototype demonstrates is letting users get  directions to the CCWO church faster and easier. I decided to create a "Get Directions" button feature on the church mobile app that linked the "I'm New" page to the Google Maps site. 
Another task that this prototype demonstrates is letting users find media content on the website easily to get a better idea of the church environment. I added large buttons  on the "Media" page to organize the media content into distinct categories: gallery and sermon audio. The third task that this prototype demonstrates is letting users find events to participate in easily and quickly. I added clickable buttons labeled by the days of the week to the "Events" page. This would allow the user to find events organized by the days of the week. 

## Decisions for the Graphical Interface Design

I added input controls like buttons and dropdown lists to take the user to new pages on the site easily. I navigational components like hyperlinks to take the user to new pages on the site and to give them more information about a certain topic. I used hyperlinks on words like "Learn more" and "View larger map". I added informational components like icons of social media sites so the user could easily identify familiar sites that they have been on before. 
I chose the color scheme by searching  church colors on the Adobe Color site. The colors that I chose looked bright and inviting which contrasts to the original color pallete of the church website. I liked the way the colors complemented each other and went with the theme of a bright church environment. I  did an accesibility audit for the colors in my prototype with Chrome developer tools. I tested the accessibility color contrast of my prototype and the audit said my prototype passed the accessibility test in background and foreground color contrast ratio.

## Revised Prototype versions based on feedback

### First Version

For the first version of my prototype, I included many of the same elements that I added to my paper wireframe except I added some real pictures to the prototype. I also added more back buttons to my prototype in the beginning. I had some trouble making the drop down tool work.

For the 2nd version of my prototype, I added an overlays to my drop down bar that created usabilty of how a real drop down bar feels on a website. I learned from the my peer in class who did wireflow testing with me that visuals are very important to help users feel engaged with site content. I added ways for the site to have images in multiple pages and added buttons that would lead them to the gallery. I also learned form my wireflow tester that it is better to write out full words on a site instead of acronyms because not all users know what certain acronyms mean. Even though it is long, I wrote out the full name of the church in my revised version.

### Final Version

For my final prototype I adjusted the color scheme of my prototype to reflect friendly and inviting church theme. I learned from my first assignment usability tester that the website logos at the top of the page usually should navigate back to the homescreen. I added a navigation function to the cross at the top of the site pages in the revised version of my prototype. I also learned from my wireflow tester that there needs to be a way to get back to the church website from pages like Google Maps or Youtube. I designed my original wireframe so a new tab page would open to these separate sites, but my users kept getting stuck and had dead ends when they got to those pages during the testing process.  I needed a way to get back to my church website without dead ends. I added an icon bar at the bottom of the Google Maps and Youtube page in my revised prototype that reflected the iPhone's icon bar where users can navigate back to their original site even after opening separate tabs to new sites. I also made the pictures become clickable and escapable with exit icons.
