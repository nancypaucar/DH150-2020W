# Usability Testing for Church Mobile Prototype by Nancy Paucar

The purpose of this UT is to learn about how easy it is for a user to learn and use the Community Chapel World Outreach prototype website. I wanted to test if my prototype allowed users to navigate through the media content of the site quickly. I also check the aesthetic and minimalistic design aspects of the website by testing if the user could find information about events easily with the revised protype. Lastly, I wanted to test if the person could find directions to the church. All of these tasks were issues that the original church website had.

### Summary

In the usability testing of the church website prototype, I recorded my participant filling out my UT survey and navigating throught the prototype using Active Presenter. I learned that the user had trouble finding the   interactive components he could click on. Many times the user was clicking randomly on the prototype not knowing what the prototype would allow him to do. The UT testing went well because my UT participant spoke about everything that he was encountering on the website. I felt like sometimes the user had trouble understanding what the tasks were asking him to do. I want to improve my UT in the future by making clearer tasks and also providing him information on how he can figure out what interactive components were available on the prototype.
