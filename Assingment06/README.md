# DH150 - Assignment 06 Low Fidelity Prototype by Nancy Paucar

## Description of Project

In my user research, I learned that when looking a a church website, most people often look for the time and place of events at the church. I also learned that people looking for a new church like to look at media contect to understand the church community before visiting. New people also look at a church website to get directions for how to get to the church.  I created a persona called Cindy May who is very organized and a planner. She just moved into a the city and was interested in visiting the CCWO church.  I also created a persona called Kate Glass who is a social media influencer and was very techy. She was interested in looking for media content on the CCWO site to find out more about the church before visiting. I also created a persona called Tim Burton who was very outgoing and social. He was interested in meeting new people and getting more involved in church events. For Cindy May, I decided to create a button feature on the church mobile app that linked the location to Google Maps site. For Kate Glass, I added a tab bar freature on the Media page to organize the media content into three distinct categories: gallery and sermon audio. For Tim Burton, I added multiple button labeled by day features that would allow the user to find events organized by days of the week. I also added a updated events section where could click to learn more about. The purpose of theis low fidelity prototyping is to begin working through how exactly the user will interact with the application for the work that I are designing. The purpose is also to gather feedback on my systemâ€™s user interactions by creating a paper prototype and testing it with another person.

## Wireframes

### Earlier Stages of Wireframes

Wireflow 1: Note: The tester could successfully complete the tasks but was confused by what the seperated boxes were next to the Gallery page. I explained that it was a Gallery slideshow feature. If he clicked the right arrows on the slide show, more pictures would slide into the mobile phone's view.

Wireflow 2 Note: The tester could successfully complete the tasks, but was confused because there was no backspace button on the Google Maps. However I let him know that the "Get Directions" button would open a new tab so he could go back whenever he wanted.

Wireflow 3 Note: The tester could successfully complete the tasks, but said there was limited pathways so it was very direct what he had to do.

## Reflection

In the process of preparing the low fidelity prototype, I learned that even wireframes take a lot of effort and thought to make. It requires thinking about different user journeys from beginning to end. Next time I would try to add more options for the pathways that users could take. I only added limited amount of options for the users to choose from but maybe that is more for the high fidelity prototypes. I think to revise the low fidelity prototype I would try to make the pictures look a little cleaner and and I would add more options for the user to go to different pages in the mobile application. For the user testing, I believe the headlines were very clear for the user to understand how to reach the prototype's main goal. In my desing the user had trouble getting back to an earlier page he started off with and his decisions started looping in a neverending cycle. I will try to add more "Go Back" options to the prototype.
