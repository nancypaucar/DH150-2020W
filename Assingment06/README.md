 # DH150 - Assignment 06 Low Fidelity Prototype by Nancy Paucar

## Description of Project

In my user research, I learned that when looking a a church website, most church members often look for the time and place of events at a church. I also learned that people looking for a new church like to look for media content to visualize the church community before visiting. New people also look at a church website to get directions for how to get to the church. People also feel a website looks more professional when it is less cluttered and has easy to use buttons. I created a persona called Cindy May who is very organized and is a planner. She just moved into the city and was interested in visiting the CCWO church. I also created a persona called Kate Glass who is a social media influencer and is very technologically advanced. She was interested in looking for media content on the CCWO church site to find out more about the church before visiting. I also created a persona called Tim Burton who is very outgoing and social. He was interested in meeting new people and getting more involved in church events. For Cindy May, I decided to create a "Get Directions" button feature on the church mobile app that linked the "I'm New" page to the Google Maps site. This would allow people who want to know how to get to CCWO church get directions faster and easier. For Kate Glass, I added a category button features on the "Media" page to organize the media content into distinct categories: gallery and sermon audio. Anyone looking for media content could look through the gallery and audio pages to get a better visualization of the church environment. For Tim Burton, I added clickable buttons labeled by the days of the week to the "Events" page. This would allow the user to find events organized by the days of the week. The purpose of this low fidelity prototyping is to begin working through how exactly the user will interact with the mobile application I am designing. The purpose is also to gather feedback on my systemâ€™s user interactions by creating a paper prototype and testing it with another person. 

## Wireframes

Wireflow 1: Note: The tester could successfully complete the tasks but was confused by what the seperated boxes were next to the Gallery page. I explained that it was a Gallery slideshow feature. If he clicked the right arrows on the slide show, more pictures would slide into the mobile phone's view. He also had a little trouble seeing what buttons were clickable in the wireflow.

Wireflow 2 Note: The tester could successfully complete the tasks, but was confused because there was no backspace button on the Google Maps. However I let him know that the "Get Directions" button would open a new tab so he could go back whenever he wanted.

Wireflow 3 Note: The tester could successfully complete the tasks, but said there was limited pathways so it was very direct what he had to do.

## Reflection

In the process of preparing the low fidelity prototype, I learned that wireframes take a lot of effort and thought to make. It requires thinking about different user journeys from beginning to end. The problem with the first prototype design was that the user had some trouble distinctly understanding what certain images were clickable in my wireframe. Next time I would try to make the buttons a little more distinct and less cluttered. In my second prototype design, the user had trouble finding ways to exit from a certain page. He would end up getting stuck in a cycle.  Next time I would try adding more "Go Back" and exit icon options to the prototype. For the third prototype design, the user only added limited amount of pathway options to choose from. I think to revise the low fidelity prototype, I would add more pathway options that would let the user go to different pages in the mobile application. For each prototype user testing, I believe the headlines were very clear for the user to understand how to reach the prototype's main goal.
