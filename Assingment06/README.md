# DH150 - Assignment 06 Low-Fi Prototype

## A brief description of your project.
 Brief summary of user-research, persona and three+ features you wrote as usage scenario; The purpose of this low-fidelity prototyping


## A list of tasks that the paper prototype of your system supported.
+1:  At least five distinctive wireframes (= sketches of the screen) that represent the input and output of the system 
+1: Thoughtful content design including proper texts and button labels

1) click on the "I'm New" tab in the main tab bar to go to the I'm new page; 
(2) Under the Location section of the page, click on the Get Directions button to open a new page to the Google Maps website;
(3) tap the due date field to open the due date picker; 
(4) Select the due date from the calendar picker; 
(6) press Save button to save the due date and dismiss the calendar picker; 
(7) tap one of three icons to set the priority to one of three possible values ; 
(8) Save the to-do to close the form and return to the list view. If you were prototyping this task, your prototype would need to support each of these eight interactions to allow the user to successfully complete the task of creating a new to-do.

## A set of pictures of the prototype in different states, showing it being tested.
+1: At least one sequence of the user interaction flow was presented with wireframes and arrow_lines 
+1: At least three features were presented via wireflow
+1: Complete interaction sequences for all the possible choices and exit/cancel/back were clearly presented via wireflow

+1: Note the tester’s confusion or unexpected interaction; Note whether the tester could successfully complete the tasks (i.e.g, three features)
+1: picture/video of the tester’s pathway

## A description of what you would change or design differently based on the feedback you got from the prototype testing. For each, describe in a sentence or two what problem the tester encountered, and in another sentence or two how you would address the problem if you were to revise the prototype.

Write a short paragraph reflecting on your experience of testing with a low-fidelity prototype. What did you learn about preparing a low-fidelity prototype? What would you do differently next time? How do you think you need to revise the low-fidelity prototype?
+1: Summary of the process, what went smoothly or differently from your expectation

+1: What you would change or design differently based on the feedback you got from the prototype testing. 

For each, describe in a sentence or two
